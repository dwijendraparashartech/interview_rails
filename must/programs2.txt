1. Given an array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], sum it up using a method.

Answer: Summation of an array is one of the most fundamental concepts in programming, and there are a lot of methods to achieve it, such as iterating the array and summing the numbers. In Ruby, it’s neat to know that we can call inject, because it’s so powerful yet simple.

def sum(array)
  return array.inject(:+)
end

2. solve the below problem :: 

Given this input:

x = [{"a" => 10},{"b" => 20},{"c" => 30}]
How can you obtain the following?

one array containing all keys
another containing all values
the sum of all the values


Sol ::  
x = [{"a" => 10},{"b" => 20},{"c" => 30}]
y = x[0].merge(x[1]).merge(x[2])
y.keys  # will return all keys
y.values # will return all values
y.values.inject(:+)   # will return the sum of all values

But a better first line would be this:

y = x.reduce(:merge)
…because it would work on an array of any size, not just the exact input given.

4. What is the problem with 
    class MyController < ApplicationController
      def options
        options = {}
        available_option_keys = [:first_option, :second_option, :third_option]
        all_keys = params.keys.map(&:to_sym)
        set_option_keys = all_keys & available_option_keys
        set_option_keys.each do |key|
          options[key] = params[key]

5. Suppose we have a Student with id=”4”. If we delete the Student with id=”4”, what will be the result of the following queries:

Student.find(4)  ------

6. What is wrong with the code below? Also, state the reason.
require "benchmark"
puts Benchmark.measure do
    break if Random.rand(100) === 1 while true
end

..

Sol :: 

Answer: The operator precedence is the issue in the code. The code will return:

LocalJumpError: no block given (yield)
As do-end is weaker than attracting arguments to the function, that’s why one either needs to surround the whole call to Benchmark.measurewith parentheses, or to use curly brackets instead of do-end.

7. Write a function that sorts the keys in a hash by the length of the key as a string. For instance, the hash:

{ abc: 'hello', 'another_key' => 123, 4567 => 'third' }
should result in:

["abc", "4567", "another_key"]


..........

Ans :: 


Best Answer ::
hsh.keys.map(&:to_s).sort_by(&:length)

Other Answers ::
hsh.keys.collect(&:to_s).sort_by { |key| key.length }
def key_sort hsh
	hsh.keys.collect(&:to_s).sort { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }
end
collect { |x| x.to_s }

..................

Ans::  hsh.keys.map(&:to_s).sort_by(&:length)


As is always true in programming, there are in fact multiple ways to accomplish this.

The most straightforward answer would be of the form:

hsh.keys.map(&:to_s).sort_by(&:length)


or:

hsh.keys.collect(&:to_s).sort_by { |key| key.length }
Alternatively, Ruby’s Enumerable mixin provides many methods to operate on collections. The key here is to turn the hash keys into a collection, convert them all to strings, then sort the array.

def key_sort hsh
	hsh.keys.collect(&:to_s).sort { |a, b| a.length <=> b.length }
end
An equivalent call of the collect method is done with the usual block syntax of:

collect { |x| x.to_s }

8.  What will val1 and val2 equal after the code below is executed? Explain your answer.

val1 = true and false  # hint: output of this statement in IRB is NOT value of val1!
val2 = true && false

..........

Ans :: 
(val1 = true) and false    # results in val1 being equal to true
val2 = (true && false)     # results in val2 being equal to false

..........

Description ::

Although these two statements might appear to be equivalent, they are not, due to the order of operations. Specifically, the and and or operators have lower precedence than the = operator, whereas the && and || operators have higher precedence than the = operator, based on order of operations.

To help clarify this, here’s the same code, but employing parentheses to clarify the default order of operations:

(val1 = true) and false    # results in val1 being equal to true
val2 = (true && false)     # results in val2 being equal to false
This is, incidentally, a great example of why using parentheses to clearly specify your intent is generally a good practice, in any language. But whether or not you use parentheses, it’s important to be aware of these order of operations rules and to thereby ensure that you are properly determining when to employ and / or vs. && / ||.

9. Consider the following code :: What will be the value of each of the following ::

..............................................................

VAL = 'Global'
 
module Foo
  VAL = 'Foo Local'
 
  class Bar
    def value1
      VAL
    end
  end
end

class Foo::Bar
  def value2
    VAL
  end
end

...

What will be the value of each of the following:

Foo::Bar.new.value1
Foo::Bar.new.value2
............................................................


..................

Ans ::

Foo::Bar.new.value1   ------    'Foo Local'
Foo::Bar.new.value2   ------     'Global'


Description ::

Foo::Bar.new.value1 will be equal to 'Foo Local' and Foo::Bar.new.value2 will be equal to 'Global'.

Here’s why:

The module keyword (as well as the class and def keywords) will create a new lexical scope for all of its contents. The above module Foo therefore creates the scope Foo in which the VAL constant equal to 'Foo Local' is defined. Inside Foo, we declare class Bar, which creates another new lexical scope (named Foo::Bar) which also has access to its parent scope (i.e., Foo) and all of its constants.

However, when we then declare Foo::Bar (i.e., using ::), we are actually creating yet another lexical scope, which is also named Foo::Bar (how’s that for confusing!). However, this lexical scope has no parent (i.e., it is entirely independent of the lexcial scope Foo created earlier) and therefore does not have any access to the contents of the ‘Foo’ scope. Therefore, inside class Foo::Bar, we only have access to the VAL constant declared at the beginning of the script (i.e., outside of any module) with the value 'Global'.

10. Is the line of code below valid Ruby code? If so, what does it do? Explain your answer.

-> (a) {p a}["Hello world"]

Yes, it’s valid. Here’s how to understand what it does:
The -> operator creates a new Proc, which is one of Ruby’s function types. (The -> is often called the “stabby proc”. It’s also called the “stabby lambda”, as it creates a new Proc instance that is a lambda. All lambdas are Procs, but not all Procs are lambdas. There are some slight differences between the two.)
This particular Proc takes one parameter (namely, a). When the Proc is called, Ruby executes the block p a, which is the equivalent of puts(a.inspect) (a subtle, but useful, difference which is why p is sometimes better than puts for debugging). So this Proc simply prints out the string that is passed to it.
You can call a Proc by using either the call method on Proc, or by using the square bracket syntax, so this line of code also invokes the Proc and passes it the string “Hello World”.
So putting that all together, this line of code (a) creates a Proc that takes a single parameter a which it prints out and (b) invokes that Proc and passes it the string “Hello world”. So, in short, this line of code prints “Hello World”.

12. Create a route to be able to display pages with different information about different types of beer. The route should recognize URL paths like /beer/<beer_type> and should use the same controller action for each type of beer with the actually beer type passed into the controller action as a parameter. The valid beer types are:
IPA
brown_ale
pilsner
lager
lambic
hefeweizen
Any other type of beer specified should generate a 404 status code.
.........................................................................

One option would be to generate a simple get route that specifies the controller action to call and passes the kind of beer as a parameter:

get 'beers/:kind' => 'beers#kind'
Then, within the context of the controller action, if the kind parameter is not included in the list of valid kinds, the action can raise a ActionController::RoutingError, which will redirect to 404 in production.

Alternatively, a simpler solution is to check against the list of valid kinds in the definition of the route. This can be accomplished using the constraints option as follows:

kinds = %w|IPA brown_ale pilsner lager lambic hefweizen|
get 'beers/:kind' => 'beers#kind', constraints: {kind: Regexp.new(kinds.join('|'))}
This code calls the BeersController#kind action method with params['kind'] set to a string representing the beer type given in the URL path. The key is using the constraints option for the route to specify a regular expression to use to verify the route is correct. In this case, the lambda checks to see that the kind parameter is included in the list of valid beer types.

Or perhaps an even better solution would be to use resource routing. This has the added benefit of providing URL generation helpers, but at the cost of requiring that the parameter name for the beer be passed as :id. This would look something like:

kinds = %w|IPA brown_ale pilsner lager lambic hefweizen|
resource :beer, only: [:show], constraints: {id: Regexp.new(kinds.join('|'))}

Q15. How would you define a Person model so that any Person can be assigned as the parent of another Person (as demonstrated in the Rails console below)? What columns would you need to define in the migration creating the table for Person?

irb(main):001:0> john = Person.create(name: "John")
irb(main):002:0> jim = Person.create(name: "Jim", parent: john)
irb(main):003:0> bob = Person.create(name: "Bob", parent: john)
irb(main):004:0> john.children.map(&:name)
=> ["Jim", "Bob"]
And for a more advanced challenge: Update the Person model so that you can also get a list of all of a person’s grandchildren, as illustrated below. Would you need to make any changes to the corresponding table in the database?

irb(main):001:0> sally = Person.create(name: "Sally")
irb(main):002:0> sue = Person.create(name: "Sue", parent: sally)
irb(main):003:0> kate = Person.create(name: "Kate", parent: sally)
irb(main):004:0> lisa = Person.create(name: "Lisa", parent: sue)
irb(main):005:0> robin = Person.create(name: "Robin", parent: kate)
irb(main):006:0> donna = Person.create(name: "Donna", parent: kate)
irb(main):007:0> sally.grandchildren.map(&:name)
=> ["Lisa", "Robin", "Donna"]

Sol ::
Normally, the target class of an ActiveRecord association is inferred from the association’s name (a perfect example of “convention over configuration”). It is possible to override this default behavior, though, and specify a different target class. Doing so, it is even possible to have relationships between two objects of the same class.

This is how it is possible to set up a parent-child relationship. The model definition would look like:

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :parent, class: Person
  has_many :children, class: Person, foreign_key: :parent_id
end
It’s necessary to specify the foreign_key option for the has_many relationship because ActiveRecord will attempt to use :person_id by default. In the migration to create the table for this model, you would need to define, at minimum, a column for the name attribute as well as an integer column for parent_id.

Self-referential relationships can be extended in all the same ways as normal two-model relationships. This even includes has_many ... :through => ... style relationships. However, because we are circumventing Rails’ conventions, we will need to specify the source of the :through in the case of adding a grandchild relationship:

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :parent, class: Person
  has_many :children, class: Person, foreign_key: :parent_id
  has_many :grandchildren, class: Person, through: :children, source: :children
end

Consequently, since this is still just using the parent_id defined in the first case, no changes to the table in the database are required.

Q16. Find and fix the bug within the code below.

class Home
  attr_reader :address

  def initialize(a)
    address = a
  end

  def call
    # perform a process that requires @address
  end

  private

  def address=(a)
    @address = clean(a)
    end

  def clean(a)
    # return sanitized address
  end
end


Answer :: 
Normally if Ruby encounters an identifier, and the identifier does not reference a defined local variable, Ruby will try to call a method with the given name. However, when Ruby encounters address = a within the initialize method, it treats address = a as a local variable initialization and fails to invoke the setter. This occurs when Ruby encounters an identifier beginning with a lowercase character or underscore on the left-hand side of an assignment operator. The solution is to clarify that we want to call the writer method address = by prepending address with the self keyword. The initialize method has been reproduced below:

def initialize(a)
  self.address = a
end
Alternatively, you could also fix the bug by directly assigning the value to the instance variable within the initialize method like so:

def initialize(a)
  @address = clean(a)
end

Q17. Predict the output of the code below. Explain your answer.
-> (s) {p s} [“I’m a Proc”]

Ans ::

This question highlights the syntactical elegance of Ruby. A seasoned coder can perform a lot with a single line of Ruby code. The -> operator, or “stabby proc” as it is often called, is a way to create a proc that is also a lambda, or nameless function. This proc takes the parameter s and executes the block {p s}, which is shorthand for puts(s.inspect) before passing the string “I’m a Proc” using the square bracket syntax in place of the typical “call” method. The result is an elegant single line of code that prints the string “I’m a Proc” to the console.

Q23.  Give an Example to Flatten  an Array without using Flatten Method   ::


There are 3 types that we can flatten an array :: 

1.Flattening an Array by One Dimension ::

my_array = [1, [2, 3, [4, 5]]]
single_flatten(my_array) #=> [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]

................

def single_flatten(array)
  results = []
  array.each do |element|
    if element.class == Array
      element.each {|value| results << value}
    else
      results << element
    end
  end
  results
end

............
Exp :: 
This method takes in an array and sets an empty results array. It then looks at each element of the array in question. If the element is an array, it will look at each element within that array, and append the nested element’s value to the results array using the shovel operator. If the element is not an array, it will append the value of that element into the the results array. Once every element in the array has either had itself or its components appended into the results, the method returns the result array, which is equivalent to the original array flattened by one dimension:



......................


2.Flattening an Array n Times

my_array = [1, [2, 3, [4, [5, 6]]]]
multiple_flatten(my_array, 2) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]

................
def multiple_flatten(array, n)
  count = 0
  arr = array
  while count < n do
    arr = single_flatten(arr)
    count += 1
  end
  arr
end

Exp :: 

First, we set the count to zero and the variable arr to our initial array. If the counter hasn’t reached the number of dimensions we’ve specified wanting to reduce our array by, arr will be passed into single_flatten. Every time the block in the while loop executes, arr is reassigned to the result of single_flatten, and the counter is incremented by one. Once the counter is equal to the number of dimensions we want to reduce by, the final return value of the method is arr, the last result of the single_flatten.


......................

3.Flattening an Array with Recursion :: Single /Total Flatten whole Array ::

my_array = [1, [2, 3, [4, 5]]]
recursive_flatten(my_array) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

.................
def recursive_flatten(array, results = [])
  array.each do |element|
    if element.class == Array
      recursive_flatten(element, results)
    else
      results << element
    end
  end
  results
end

.................

Exp :: 


Like the single flatten, it checks if an element is an array, and if not, appends the value of the element to a results array. However, if the element is an array, the method calls itself pulling in this element and the existing results array. The method will keep calling itself on the elements of elements until all the elements are not arrays and can be pushed into the results array.

Because we want the method to be completely recursive, we’re setting results to an optional argument that defaults to an empty array. If we set the results array to be empty within the method, it will reset the results array every time the function is called. The first time we call recursive_flatten, we call it without the results argument. This way, it will create our initially empty results array that will then be filled passed around and into the other recursive_flatten methods and never be reset back to being empty!

Example of sort array :: 

#Using bubble sort algorithm in ruby

a = [1,5,7,2,3,50,78,34,89]

a.size.times.each do |t|
 i=0
 a.each do |b|
   if b > a[i+1]
     a[i],a[i+1] = a[i+1],a[i]
   end
   i+=1 if i < a.size-2
 end
end
print a


# with swapped true method 

def my_sort(list)
  return list if list.size <= 1 

  swapped = false
  while !swapped
    swapped = false
    0.upto(list.size-2) do |i|
      if list[i] > list[i+1]
        list[i], list[i+1] = list[i+1], list[i]
        swapped = true
      end
    end
  end

  list
end

print my_sort([2,1,3,5,4,40])


# Sort an Array program with sort method - ascending and descending type::

print [0,8,5,4,22,1,4].sort_by{|number| number}
print [0,8,5,4,22,1,4].sort_by{|number| number}.reverse

Q26. 
controller action as a parameter. The valid music genres are as follows: classical, rock, house, country, hip_hop, and rnb. All other genres should generate a 404 status code.
You will likely receive a variety of potential answers for an open-ended coding question like this, but here are two of the most straightforward approaches to creating a route. The most straightforward solution would be to create a simple route that specifies the controller action to call and passes the genre of music as a parameter. If the genre parameter is not included in the list of valid genres, the action will raise an ActionController::RoutingError and redirect to a 404 page.

get 'music/:genre' => 'music#genre'
Alternatively, a better solution would be to use resource routing which comes with the added benefit of URL generation helpers. You can use the constraints option to verify the validity of a route by checking the parameter against a list of genres. This method requires that the parameter name for the genre be passed as :id and would look something like this:

genres = %w|classical rock house country hip_hop rnb|
resource :music, only: [:show], constraints: {id: Regexp.new(genres.join('|'))}

Q27. How would you flatten the following?
hash = { a: { b: { c: 42, d: 'foo' }, d: 'bar' }, e: 'baz' }
to

{ :a_b_c=>42, :a_b_d=>"foo", :a_d=>"bar", :e=>"baz" }
λ = ->(h, key = nil) do
  h.map do |k, v|
    _k = key ? "#{key}_#{k}" : k.to_s
    v.is_a?(Hash) ? λ.call(v, _k) : [_k.to_sym, v]
  end.flatten #⇒ note flatten 
end
Hash[*λ.call(hash)]
#⇒ {:a_b_c=>42, :a_b_d=>"foo", :a_d=>"bar", :e=>"baz"}
Understanding recursion is important. While all these Fibonacci numbers and factorials are repeated over and over again, the real-world tasks are less academic. Walking through the hash in the described manner is often a must.

The exercise might be stated as the exact opposite: given the “flattened” form of the hash, rebuild its nested representation.

Q28. 

Consider the following:
Given the following syntactic sugar:

(1..42).reduce &:*
#⇒ 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000
What makes this notation to be an equivalent of:

(1..42).reduce { |memo, elem| memo * elem }
Does the Ruby parser handle this particular case, or could this be implemented in plain Ruby?

The candidate can monkeypatch to the Symbol class with their own implementation of the aforementioned syntactic sugar.

E.g.

class Symbol
def to_proc
  # this implementation in incomplete
  # — more sophisticated question: why?
  # — even more hard: re-implement it properly
lambda { |memo, recv| memo.public_send(self, recv)  }
end
end
(1..42).reduce &:*
#⇒ 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000
There is not much magic in this example. An ampersand converts an argument, that is apparently a Symbol instance here, to Proc object, simply calling to_proc method on it. The implementation is Symbol#to_proc in done in C for performance reasons, but the candidate can write their own implementation in Ruby to make sure everything works as expected.

Answers to additional questions in the code: — the code above fails when the callee expects to receive one parameter only

(e.g. a try to use this implementation with Enumerator#each)

will fail with an arity error:

(1..42).each &:*
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2)
To fix this, the candidate should use the splat argument to lambda and analyze the amount of actual argument passed:

lambda do |*args|
  case args.size
  when 1 then # each-like
when 2 then # with accumulator
...

Q28.  What’s wrong with the code below and why?
require 'benchmark'
puts Benchmark.measure do  
    break if Random.rand(100) === 1 while true
end
Operator precedence matters! The code will return

LocalJumpError: no block given (yield)
As do-end is weaker than attracting arguments to the function, that’s why one either needs to surround the whole call to Benchmark.measure with parentheses, or to use curly brackets instead of do-end.

Q29.  Build an array based on the following scenario.
Provided we have a hash of a fixed structure (e. g. we receive this hash from a third-party data provider, that guarantees the structure):

input = [ {a1: 42, b1: { c1: 'foo' }}, 
{a2: 43, b2: { c2: 'bar' }}, 
{a3: 44, b3: { c3: 'baz' }},
… ]
How can one build an array of cN values (['foo', bar', baz'])?

Some examples would be:

input.map { |v| v.to_a.last.last.to_a.last.last }
or

input.map { |v| v.flatten.last.flatten.last }
Here one iterates through the array, collecting nested hashes and using an index to build the requested key name, but there is more straightforward approach. Hash is an Enumerable, which gives the developer an ability to query it almost as what has been done with an array.

Q30. 
 Consider the following scenario related to variables.
Given the code below, how one might access the @foo variable from outside? Is it an instance variable, or class variable? What object this variable is defined on?

class Foo
  class << self
    @foo = 42
  end
end
You can access the variable with

(class << Foo ; @foo ; end)
It’s an instance variable and defined on Foo’s Singleton method, or more specifically, the eigenclass of Foo.

Each class in Ruby has its own “eigenclass.” This eigenclass is derived from Class class. Foo class is an instance of it’s eigenclass. This eigenclass has the only instance Foo; it as well has instance methods, defined as class methods on Foo, and it might have instance variables, e. g. @foo variable in this particular example.

Q31. 
 Consider the following two methods

Method 1 - def times_two(arg1);
