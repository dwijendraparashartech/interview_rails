Q.What Do You Mean By Naming Convention In Rails.
Ans: Variables: Variables are named where all letters are lowercase and words are separated by underscores. E.g: total, order_amount. Class and Module: Classes and modules uses MixedCase and have no underscores, each word starts with a uppercase letter. Eg: InvoiceItem Database Table: Table name have all lowercase letters and underscores between words, also all table names to be plural. Eg: invoice_items, orders etc Model: The model is named using the class naming convention of unbroken MixedCase and always the singular of the table name. For eg: table name is might be orders, the model name would be Order. Rails will then look for the class definition in a file called order.rb in /app/model directory. If the model class name has multiple capitalized words, the table name is assumed to have underscores between these words. Controller: controller class names are pluralized, such that Orders Controller would be the controller class for the orders table. Rails will then look for the class definition in a file called orders_controlles.rb in the /app/controller directory.
