Authentication and Auhorization Gems ::

Authentication is the process of verifying who you are.
Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to resources.
.............................................................................

CanCanCan Gem ::  Simple authorization solution for Rails. All permissions are stored in a single location.

pundit :: Object oriented authorization for Rails applications

rolify :: Very simple Roles library without any authorization enforcement supporting scope on resource objects (instance or class). Supports ActiveRecord and Mongoid ORMs.

jwt :: Dynamic JWT authentication and secrets rotation in Rails applications. JSON Web Tokens, commonly known as JWT is an open standard for representing and verifying claims securely between a client and a server. It is one of the most popular authentication and authorization techniques employed in modern applications.

Authentication Gems ::

OmniAuth Gem ::
OmniAuth is a library that allows you to implement multi-provider authentication for web applications. For example, if you wanted to authenticate your users using their Google or Facebook accounts, you could use the OmniAuth gem to delegate the authentication to those providers.OmniAuth introduces the concept of strategies. A strategy is a provider who will perform the authentication. In the example above, it'll be the Google and Facebook strategies.

..................................................

Devise Gem ::
The Devise gem is an authentication solution for Ruby on Rails applications; it helps you set up production-ready user authentication in your projects without having to do everything on your own.

It's composed of 10 modules:

Database Authenticatable: hashes and stores a password in the database to validate the authenticity of a user while signing in. The authentication can be done both through POST requests or HTTP Basic Authentication.
Omniauthable: adds OmniAuth (https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) support.
Confirmable: sends emails with confirmation instructions and verifies whether an account is already confirmed during sign in.
Recoverable: resets the user password and sends reset instructions.
Registerable: handles signing up users through a registration process, also allowing them to edit and destroy their account.
Rememberable: manages generating and clearing a token for remembering the user from a saved cookie.
Trackable: tracks sign in count, timestamps and IP address.
Timeoutable: expires sessions that have not been active in a specified period of time.
Validatable: provides validations of email and password. It's optional and can be customized, so you're able to define your own validations.
Lockable: locks an account after a specified number of failed sign-in attempts. Can unlock via email or after a specified time period.

.............................




Authorization Gems ::

Pundit Gem :
Pundit is a gem that provides a set of helpers that guide you to use simple Ruby objects and object-oriented design patterns to create an authorization system. It's easy to use, has minimal permissions, and is great for managing role-based authorization using policies defined in simple Ruby classes.


CanCanCan Gem :
CanCanCan is a gem that provides an easy way to authorize actions in your Rails application. It allows you to define abilities for different roles in your application, and then check whether a user is authorized to perform a certain action.

CanCan is an authorization library for Ruby on Rails which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. All permissions are defined in a single location (the Ability class) and not duplicated across controllers, views, and database queries.

Q- What is the diff between pundit gem and cancancan gem ::

pundit :: Is about Policy
CanCanCan :: Is about Ability
